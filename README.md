# data folder is mostly JAVA folder, POJO objects. So variable naming in that fodlers don't start with m. I followed java coding styles on # that folder.

# android folder is pure android. 
# the database will be empty initially. All data are saved on the database, excep Account information which i hardcoded.
# I tried to follow Outllook calendar GUI/concept as much as possible. There might be few GUI issues which i can handle if I have little  # more time.

# All events are divided to timeSlots. A timeSlot is an object which keeps a data of a single day. So, events which covers 3 days are  divided into 3 timeSlots.
# I used icons from Google https://material.io/icons/#ic_alarm
